# Final Report

## Summary
This project focuses on detecting screen time fatigue using eye-related parameters.
Face detection, eye detection, blink rate calculation,fatigue decision logic, and alert system are implemented.

## Conclusion
The system successfully identifies fatigue conditions based on blink rate thresholds.
It helps users understand their screen usage and encourages taking breaks.

## Future Scope
- Add machine learning model for better accuracy
- Use mobile or laptop usage data
- Add sound or notification alerts
- Improve accuracy using more eye parameters
