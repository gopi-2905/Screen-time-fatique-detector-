# Screen Time Fatigue Detection

Screen Time Fatigue Detection is a machine learning based project.
It helps to identify user fatigue caused by long screen usage.
The system aims to reduce eye strain and improve healthy screen habits.

## Problem Statement
People spend long hours in front of screens for study and work.
This leads to eye fatigue, headache, and loss of concentration.
There is a need for a system to detect screen time fatigue.

## Objective
- To analyze screen usage behavior
- To detect fatigue using eye-related parameters
- To alert users to take breaks

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- Machine Learning
- NumPy, Pandas

## Project Status
Day 1: Problem analysis, tool selection, and GitHub repository setup completed.
