Day 2 – Dataset / Parameter Study

On Day 2, eye-related parameters are studied for fatigue detection.
Important parameters such as blink rate, eye closure duration,
and head posture are analyzed.

Threshold values and data requirements are identified.
These parameters will be used to detect fatigue conditions in later stages.
Basic research is done on how eye landmarks can be extracted
using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
